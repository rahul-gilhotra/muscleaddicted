                            <br>1. Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. 
                            <br>2. Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you.
                            <br>3. As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.
                            <br>4. Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.
                            <br>5. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program

                            * INSTRUCTIONS TO DO IT : 
                            <br>1. Begin with the barbell supported on top of the traps. The chest should be up and the head facing forward. Adopt a hip-width stance with the feet turned out as needed.
                            <br>2. Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires that the knees travel forward. Ensure that they stay align with the feet. The goal is to keep the torso as upright as possible.
                            <br>3. Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel. At the moment the upper legs contact the lower legs reverse the motion, driving the weight upward.
                            <br>4. Lower the bar to the sternum by flexing the elbows. Maintain control and do not bounce the bar off of your chest. Your lats should stay tight and elbows slightly drawn in.
                            <br>5. After touching your torso with the bar, extend the elbows to return the bar to the starting position.

                            * INSTRUCTIONS TO DO IT : 
                            <br>1. Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie face down on the leg curl machine with the pad of the lever on the back of your legs (just a few inches under the calves). Tip: Preferably use a leg curl machine that is angled as opposed to flat since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment.
                            <br>2. Position your toes straight . This will be your starting position.
                            <br>4. As you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.
                            <br>5. As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position . Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

                            <br>1. Place the back of your torso against the back pad of the machine and hook your shoulders under the shoulder pads provided.
                            <br>2. Position your legs in the platform using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. 
                            <br>3. Place your arms on the side handles of the machine and disengage the safety bar .
                            <br>4. Now straighten your legs without locking the knees. This will be your starting position.
                            <br>5. Begin to slowly lower the unit by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up (back on the pad at all times). Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
                            <br>6. Begin to raise the unit as you exhale by pushing the floor with mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.
                            <br>7. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

                            * INSTRUCTIONS TO DO IT : 
                            <br>1. This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the bar on the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck).
                            <br>2. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.
                            <br>3. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. The knees should be kept with a slight bend; never locked. This will be your starting position.
                            <br>4. Raise your heels as you breathe out by extending your ankles as high as possible and flexing your calf. Ensure that the knee is kept stationary at all times. There should be no bending at any time. Hold the contracted position by a second before you start to go back down.
                            <br>5. Go back slowly to the starting position as you breathe in by lowering your heels as you bend the ankles until calves are stretched.
                            <br>6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
