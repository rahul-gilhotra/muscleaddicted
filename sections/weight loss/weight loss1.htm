		* Nuts are rich in fibre, protein, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals that also help lose weight and burn belly fat. 
		<br>
			*Nuts for burning belly fat and losing weight are Almonds, Walnuts, Pistachios, Brazil Nuts, Cashew Nuts.
		<br>
		*Nuts are a handy snack to stash in your purse, taste great atop a mixed salad, and can be added to your favorite smoothie recipe for a protein boost.
		<br>
		*nuts have been scientifically proven to help you shed pounds. In a review of scientific literature on the topic, researchers found that eating nuts is associated with greater weight loss, better diet compliance, and improved satiety.
		<br>
		*In fact, in a study of 65 overweight or obese adults, eating a diet high in almonds was associated with greater weight loss, decreased waist circumference, lower body fat, and reduced systolic blood pressure <br>*These benefits are thought to be due to almonds’ high content of monounsaturated fats. Out of the 11 grams of fat in a serving of almonds, 7 grams are from these beneficial monounsaturated fatty acids

	*Adding strawberries and mulberries (shehtoot) in your breakfast is one of the best bets to make your breakfast weight-loss friendly. You can add these to your oatmeal, daliya or cereal bowl to ensure a constant supply of nutrition in your body. 
	<br>
	*Tasty, refreshing and succulent, mulberries and strawberries are full of soluble fibres and dietary fibres that help to boost the body’s digestive system. A good digestion is the most basic step towards losing weight.
<br>
	*Mulberries help in strengthening the digestive tract and can ease constipation and bloating. While strawberries, on the other hand, make your heart healthy, improve your digestion and is the only fruit to have a small amount of omega 3 fatty acid.
	<br>
	*Mulberries can be used as a substitute for sugar as they are sweet in taste. Strawberries tend to quickly lose their nutrition after they are picked, so it’s best to consume strawberries soon after they are picked. Not just in your breakfast, you can add these two berries to make a smoothie or a refreshing beverage as well.
	<br>
	*Our kitchen shelves are loaded with ingredients that are a powerhouse of nutrition. Same goes for some readily available fruits that come handy and can make your regular meals even more nutritious and weight-loss friendly.

<p style="position: absolute;top: 880px;left: 350px">
	*Numerous dietitians and nutritionists have suggested eating low-carb foods for quick weight loss. And coconut is a fruit which is low in carbs and can effectively help in weight loss.
	<br>
	*She goes on to explain about the health benefits of having coconut oil on a daily basis. "Coconut has anti-inflammatory properties and is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. It is a healthier version of your regular refined oil. Having coconut oil as a supplement or cooking your food in coconut oil gives a lot of nutrients to your body. 
	<br>
	*Coconut oil prevents acidity in the stomach. It also has anti-bacterial properties. Any skin issues can be addressed by having coconut oil regularly," says Sapna while adding that coconut oil helps in weight loss because it is absorbed by the body in a very healthy manner.
	<br>
	*Eating coconuts can satiate your hunger and make you feel full for longer. Medium-chain triglyceride fat in coconut helps in achieving satiety. Sugar content in coconut gives instant energy to the body. It prevents repeated hunger and reduces cravings, thereby keeping blood sugar levels under control. You can add fresh coconut to smoothies or coconut flakes in salads and cooked dishes.

<B style="font-size: 30px;position: absolute;top: 1150px;left: 15px">4. EGGS</B></h1>

<p style="position: absolute;top: 1180px;left: 350px">
	*Protein aids weight loss because it is extremely filling, and eggs are a good source of protein, with one large egg providing approximately 6 grams (g).

The dietary reference intake for protein is 0.8 g per kilogram of body weight.
	<br>
	*A large hard-boiled egg contains 78 calories and several important nutrients, including:

lutein and zeaxanthin, which are antioxidants that support healthy eyesight
vitamin D, which promotes bone health and immune function
choline, which boosts the metabolism and helps with fetal brain development
	<br>
	*a lunch or dinner of two hard-boiled eggs and a cup of mixed vegetables contains just 274 calories.

However, cooking eggs with oils or butter increases the caloric and fat contents significantly. A tablespoon of olive oil, for example, contains 119 calories.
	<br>
	*According to the findings of a 2014 study:

Protein increases a person's metabolic rate by 15–30 percent.
Carbohydrates increase the metabolic rate by 5–10 percent.
Fats increase the metabolic rate by as much as 3 percent.
Therefore, eating eggs and other high-protein foods may help people to burn more calories than eating carbohydrates or fats.

<p style="position: absolute;top: 1580px;left: 350px">
*Eating vegetables provides health benefits – people who eat more vegetables as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases. Vegetables provide nutrients vital for health and maintenance of your body.
	<br>
	* vegetables have a lot of fibre and are full of nutrition like essential minerals and vitamins that may help your body improve metabolism and subsequently burn belly fat. Including these in your diet may help you not just in your weight loss journey, but also to live a long and healthy life. 
	<br>
	*The phrase "abs are made in the kitchen" is not an exaggeration and including these fat burning veggies in your diet will help you reach your body goals faster.
	<br>
	*Most vegetables are naturally low in fat and calories. None have cholesterol. Vegetables are important sources of many nutrients, including potassium, dietary fiber, folate (folic acid), vitamin A, and vitamin C.
	<br>
	*Diets rich in potassium may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. Vegetable sources of potassium include sweet potatoes, white potatoes, white beans, tomato products (paste, sauce, and juice), beet greens, soybeans, lima beans, spinach, lentils, and kidney beans.

	*Drinking lemon juice and hot water for weight loss is a common practice among dieters. After all, the lemonade diet, the lemon juice detox diet and other similar cleansing programs are all the rage nowadays. Although there's nothing magic about lemon, this versatile citrus fruit is rich in vitamin C and flavonoids, reduces water retention and may help support your body's fat-burning.
<br>
	*This juicy fruit boasts large doses of naringenin, apigenin, hesperidin and other flavonoid compounds with cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity effects, reports a March 2019 review published in Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity. It's also a good source of vitamin C, which may play a role in obesity prevention and treatment
	<br>
*As the review authors note, citrus flavonoids have the potential to improve cardiovascular health and insulin sensitivity. At the same time, they reduce obesity and suppress inflammation in adipose tissue. 
	<br>
	*These phytonutrients occur naturally in most fruits and veggies, not just in lemons. Strawberries, blueberries, apples, limes and peppers are all excellent sources of flavonoids.

<B style="font-size: 30px;position: absolute;top: 2150px;left: 15px">7 WHOLE GRAINS</B></h1>
<img src="whole grains.jpeg" 
	 style="position: absolute;top: 2180px;left: 15px;border-radius: 45px;background: url();background-position: left top;background-repeat: repeat;padding: 20px;width: 275px;height: 183px">
<p style="position: absolute;top: 2180;left: 350px">
*The good-for-weight-loss whole grains are those, like brown rice, whole oats, unhulled barley, and buckwheat groats, that have not gone through the grinding, or processing, of their kernels into flour.
<br>
*These whole grains contain only about 500 calories per pound. That’s a lot of food. It means you can eat them until you’re comfortably full without going overboard on calories.
<br>
*The not-good-for-weight-loss grains are those, like whole-grain breads, whole-grain bagels, and whole-grain crackers and chips, in which the kernels have been ground into flour.
<br>
*When this processing happens, the product becomes very calorie dense. Whole-grain breads have a calorie density of around 1,200 to 1,500 calories per pound. Whole-grain, fat-free chips are 1,600 to 1750 calories per pound.

That’s right, ounce for ounce, you’re getting about three times as many calories compared to eating unprocessed whole grains.</p>

<img src="salmon.jpeg" style="position: absolute;top: 2480px;left: 15px;border-radius: 45px;background: url();background-position: left top;background-repeat: repeat;padding: 20px;width: 275px;height: 183px"width="275"height="183">
<p style="position: absolute;top: 2480px;left: 350px">
*Eating salmon for weight loss is especially effective if it is part of an overall healthy diet. This will include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other nutritious foods. Salmon has far less unhealthy fat than beef, and it offers more protein per serving as well.
	
<BR>
	*For those who are trying to cut down on calories—and particularly for those who have gone through weight loss surgery and can must eat small, nutrient dense meals—this makes salmon a valuable dietary addition. Protein helps you feel full, promotes muscle regeneration, and ultimately assists with weight loss.
	<BR>
		*The nutrients found in salmon are also helpful whether or not you are currently trying to lose weight. In particular, salmon provides you with high levels of:

Omega-3 fatty acids, which improve heart health and reduce blood pressure;
Vitamin B-12, which assists your metabolism and nervous system function; and
Selenium, which helps your immune system, thyroid, and fertility.
		<BR>
			*When eating salmon for weight loss, it’s important to know how to select it and prepare it. The best option is fresh, wild-caught salmon since there is a lower risk of PCBs (harmful chemicals that may be found in farmed salmon).

If wild-caught salmon is not an option, farmed salmon is still a good choice provided it’s properly prepared. Simply remove the skin and outer layer of fat since that’s where PCBs will be concentrated. After that, it’s safe to cook and eat.
