                        * For those trying to add more muscle, milk is an excellent protein source that provides both casein and whey proteins. Research has even shown it can help you add muscle when combined with weight lifting.

                        * Additionally, studies have found that milk, or whey and casein combined, can lead to greater mass gain than other protein sources.
